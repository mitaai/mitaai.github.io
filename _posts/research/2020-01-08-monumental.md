## Description

> Monuments venerate a person or commemorate an event, relevant to a social groupâ€™s collective memory and history. In recent years, communities have been rethinking who and what they have memorialized, and if in fact their local monuments are commemorating intolerance, violence and hatred when viewed through a fuller understanding of lesser-known histories. [Monumental Memory](https://lyip12.github.io/memorial/) is a public participatory platform built to preserve local institutional memory and document the journey of the debates, controversies, and changes to known community history in the Boston area. 

This project was completed during the Fall 2019 semester course, [CMS.633/833: Digital Humanities: Topics, Techniques, and Technologies](https://cms633.github.io) by students Anna Ivanov, Karyn Pugliese, Lucy Yip, and Meesh Zucker.
