## Description
> The [Wikipedia Dramatizer](https://xd.adobe.com/view/a1bcf7d2-b13d-46fd-4e53-a28557a81980-d78d/) is a simple dashboard that exposes the dynamic human processes behind the creation of Wikipedia entries. It allows users to gain insight on an article's history by breaking down its specific editors' contributions across various sections. It also enables examinations of discrete moments in an article's creation or sweeping overviews of edits across its edit history.

This project was completed during the Fall 2019 semester course, [CMS.633/833: Digital Humanities: Topics, Techniques, and Technologies](https://cms633.github.io) by students Will Freudenheim and Shiyi Peng.
