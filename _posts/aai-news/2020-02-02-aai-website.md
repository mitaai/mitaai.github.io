Welcome to the new Active Archives Initiative website. Over the past several months, graduate research assitant Ben Silverman has developed this design in consultation with lead researcher Kurt Fendt and undergraduate research assistant Lizao Wang. The goal with the new design is to showcase the Initiative's most recent work as well as items from the Active Archives Insights newsletter.
