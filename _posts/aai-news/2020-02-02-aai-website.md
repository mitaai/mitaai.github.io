Welcome to the new Active Archives Initiative website. Over the past several months, graduate research assitant Ben Silverman has developed this design in consultation with lead researcher Kurt Fendt and undergraduate research assistant Lizao Wang. The goal with the new design is to showcase the Initiative's most recent work as well as items from the Active Archives Insights newsletter.

We are still working out the kinks with the new design and layout. If you have questions about the website, or the Active Archives Initiative in general, please do not hesitate to reach us at <a href="mailto:aai-info@mit.edu">aai-info@mit.edu</a>.

Code for this website is also published on GitHub at [mitaai/mitaai.github.io](https://github.com/mitaai/mitaai.github.io). Please feel free to file bug reports or feature requests on the issue tracker there as well.
