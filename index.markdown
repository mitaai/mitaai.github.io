# Reimagining digital archives as platforms for creative engagement


## Active Archives

* Engage a broad range of users, from the general public to specialists, from scholarship to education
* Enable users to create and tell stories with archival materials
* Involve users in the active curation of archival materials
* Support critical scholarly engagement across disciplines
* Empower communities to create their own narratives and document their histories
* Employ machine learning technologies to support users in finding related materials
* Allow users to transparently enhance machine learning algorithms
* Integrate modular digital tools such as annotation, visual representations, curation
*   Connect to different front ends (web, mobile) and technologies (360, XR)
